# IT6033-Practical-Task-3-Searching-Algorithms
Starter code for assignment IT6033 Practical Task 3

## Framework

Students are provided with a framework for programming their algorithms. This will consist of:
  - a starter SequentialSearchString class, with methods 
    * indexOf(String term, String[] collection) 
    * main (args)

  - a starter BinarySearchString class, with methods 
    * indexOf(String term, String[] collection)
    * main (args)

  - test data files of different sizes, from small to very large:
    * sequences of strings (movie titles)

Additionally corresponding JUnit test classes with test data and expected outputs:
  - SequentialSearchStringTest
  - BinarySearchStringTest
  - and instructions on how to run test cases in NetBeans
  - and a test suite that allows to run both test classes in one go

## Student Assessment Tasks
Students will program the following algorithms to solve a real world problem:  
1. a sequential search on an arrays of strings, read from an input file.
2. a binary search on an arrays of strings, read from an input file.

Classes provided, in the classroom repository _Practical Task 3: Searching Algorithms_:
* in folder src/searchassessment  
  - SequentialSearchString.java
  - BinarySearchString.java
* in folder test/searchassessment 
  - SequentialSearchStringTest.java
  - BinarySearchStringTest.java
  - SearchAssessmentTestSuite.java
  
Test data provided:
* in folder data/searchassessment
  - files called movieTitles20.txt to movieTitles2Million.txt
  - sample test output listings to show measurements
  
Students will measure and compare running time and number of steps 
for algorithms a and b, on input data files of various sizes.
